    It executes the contract, and returns the resulting `trace` of execution - which is the decompiled form.


    The most difficult part of this module is the loop detection and simplification algorithm.
    In over 10 iterations I didn't find a simpler way that is just as effective.

    Unfortunately, because of the complexity, I don't fully understand how it works.
    Ergo, I cannot explain it to you :) Good luck!
