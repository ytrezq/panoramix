"""

    Simplifier engine.

    It takes the trace, and performs rewrites in the following loop:
        - simplify expressions
        - inline and cleanup variables (when possible)
        - inline and cleanup memory (when possible)
        - split setmems
        - split storage writes into separate lines
        - replace msize with actual values if possible
        - if there are any obvious always-fulfilled conditions, remove them
        - look for loops that are really setmems and clean those too
        - for loops that access storage, rewrite them so they are easier to parse by storage parser

    Finally, after all the processing is done:
    - replace `max(2+x, 3+y)` with `2 + max(x, 1+y)` - more human-readable, but would cause problems in the loop
    - do some other stuff that is human readable but would make the processing in the loop difficult


    If you want to see the engine in all it's glory, try:
        panoramix.py kitties tokenMetadata

    If you want to figure out exactly what happens, pprint_trace(trace) and pprint_repr(trace)
    are your friend. Put them in various places in simplify_trace and and see how the code changes.

"""

"""

    Pro tips:

        - rules in simplifier are quite independent. you can disable and move around a lot of the stuff
          and still maintain the mathematical correctedness of the output

        - the worst that will happen is that some edge cases in some contracts won't get simplified, but they
          will still be correct

        - bulk_compare.py is your friend for testing your changes. in Eveem I use something like it for initial
          tests and then do a huge integration comparison before each release, checking thousands of contracts for
          changes

        - if you like this approach, be sure to check out the work of people from Kestrel Institute, and their use
          of ACL2. They built a decompiler with a similar structure, but with simplification rules formally proven(!).
