"""

    Folder takes takes all the execution paths, and merges them into
    one, as concise as possible.

    In other words - it turns intermediate representation available
    through API/.json, that is easy to parse by machine, and turns
    it into a representation that is easy to read by humans, and
    a much shorter one.


    This (and the vm.py/loops) algorithm is one of the two most difficult
    ones within the decompiler.

    While the code can be cleaned up and refactored, I'm not sure the algorithm
    could be much simpler.
