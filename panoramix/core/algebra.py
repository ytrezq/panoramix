#
#  Algebra handles symbolic operations and comparisons
#
#  E.g. if you want to figure out if ('ADD', 2, 'x') is bigger than 'x'.,
#       you call lt_op(add_op(2,'x'), 'x')
#
#  The code here is crazy-fragile and inconsistent.
#  Modifying it is akin to playing kal-toh ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8i2idMe142s )
#
#  Should be refactored together with arithmetic.py
#  I considered replacing it with a generic SMT-solver, but I'm quite sure a generic
#  solution would be way slower.
#
#  A better option would be to use a system similar to ACL2.
